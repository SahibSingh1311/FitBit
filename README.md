# FitBit
This Python Application uses Data Analysis and ML to predict whether the user will have a chance of any heart decease in the coming 10 years, by using BMI, and other fitness details such as Blood pressure, sugar value, smoking, alcholist, etc.
The Data entered by the user is stored on the Gooogle Firebase and is connected to the Firebase using a JSON file.

P.S>This code as is in the file will not work as it is missing the JSON file.
First Create a FireBase from https://firebase.google.com/
Then download the corrosponding JSON file for your database.
The JSON file should be stored inside your project where your "health.py" file is present.

We used 3800+ unique valued data for training purpose and have tested 200+ values. 

The Application, on the last screen will also help the user to view patients near him/her.
